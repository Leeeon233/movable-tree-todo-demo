# Loro Movable Tree Demo

This project is a collaborative TodoMVC application built using Loro. 

It incorporates the concept of parent and child tasks to demonstrate the capability of combining **Movable Tree** with other basic data types. Additionally, you can use the slider located below to rewind history.
